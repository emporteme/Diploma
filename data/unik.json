It is the first non-state technical university with the status of a non-profit organization. Education is conducted in Kazakh and Russian languages. In 2013, training in English began in two specialties so far: 'Radio Engineering, Electronics and Telecommunications' and 'Power Engineering'. In 1989, the Almaty Energy Institute was the first in Kazakhstan and one of the few in the Soviet Union to be certified by the Commission of the State Inspectorate of State Education of the USSR. The high level of training of specialists at the AEI was officially recognized at the union level, and this is an undoubted success for the team of students, teachers and the leadership of the institute. In May 1997, 'UNK EiTK' was transformed into the Almaty Institute of Energy and Communications with the status of a non-profit joint stock company. Gumarbek Zhusupbekovich Daukeev was elected rector of the new institute. Since July 2010, the Almaty Institute of Energy and Communications has received the status of a university with the right to train PhD undergraduates and doctoral students and a new name - non-profit joint stock company 'Almaty University of Energy and Communications' (AUES).",
